## styles 

I am using styled components, but there will be pages where I use pure css 

##### Notes

- positon property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element
- Static being the default, where elements render in order as they appear in the doc flow.
- there is absolute, where an element is positioned relative to its first positioned ancestor element
- fixed - The element is positioned relative to the browser window
- relative - The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position

##### The max-width property

- max-width defines the maximum width of an element. It prevents the element's width from being larger than the specific value. 
- it is useful for creating responsive layouts and to ensure content readability across varios screen sizes.
